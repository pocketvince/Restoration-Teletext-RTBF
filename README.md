## Description
On 12/02/2024, RTBF decided to discontinue its teletext service.

In the past, RTBF teletext offered access to subtitles, news, sports updates, weather,... Making it a key information source before the internet.

I first encountered teletext in the late 90's.

Coming from a modest family without internet or a computer, teletext was a game-changer.

Although exporting from old VHS tapes failed, I found archived versions of RTBF teletext on the Wayback Machine.

My goal now is to extract as many screenshots as possible, enhance them, and recreate a snapshot of the past.

Teletext evolved over the years, and I‚Äôll keep updating the project on GitHub.
