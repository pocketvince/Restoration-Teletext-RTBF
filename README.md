# üì∫ Restoration Teletext RTBF

This project aims to restore and preserve the teletext history of RTBF.

By archiving this legacy content, the goal is to save a valuable piece of broadcasting history for future reference and research.

Watch the evolution of the map and download the archives via https://teletext.pocketvince.com

## Description
On 12/02/2024, RTBF decided to discontinue its teletext service.

In the past, RTBF teletext offered access to subtitles, news, sports updates, weather,... Making it a key information source before the internet.

I first encountered teletext in the late 90's.

Coming from a modest family without internet or a computer, teletext was a game-changer.

Although exporting from old VHS tapes failed, I found archived versions of RTBF teletext on the Wayback Machine.

My goal now is to extract as many screenshots as possible, enhance them, and recreate a snapshot of the past.

Teletext evolved over the years, and I‚Äôll keep updating the project on GitHub.

## Last Update
20240915: A visual part has been added on the site which allows navigation between pages, sub-pages and date.
During creation it was noticed that some images have the wrong date, this is related to the fact that the capture keeps the initial date, but the wayback machine seems to return the same images for different date, a manual cleaning will have to be done in the future :)

20240909: I've set up a small website to share the archives with updates of the image map to have a vision of what needs to be completed, and the image archives, I guess within a few weeks I'll have enough data to start the clean and visualization part.

20240908: The script works and doesn't seem to return any errors, it's currently running on my laptop, my vps, my raspberry pi and on 2 old 3G phones, the archives are filling up quite quickly.
