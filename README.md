![Alt text](https://github.com/pocketvince/Restoration-Teletext-RTBF/blob/main/picture.gif?raw=true "todo")

This project aims to restore and preserve the teletext history of RTBF.
By archiving this legacy content, the goal is to save a valuable piece of broadcasting history for future reference and research.

## Description
On 12/02/2024, RTBF decided to discontinue its teletext service.
In the past, RTBF teletext offered access to subtitles, news, sports updates, weather,... Making it a key information source before the internet.

I first encountered teletext in the late 90's.
Coming from a modest family without internet or a computer, teletext was a game-changer.

Although exporting from old VHS tapes failed, I found archived versions of RTBF teletext on the Wayback Machine.
My goal now is to extract as many screenshots as possible, enhance them, and recreate a snapshot of the past.

Teletext evolved over the years, and I‚Äôll keep updating the project on GitHub.
